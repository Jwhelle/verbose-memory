    <tr>
      <p>Lake Erie Shores Public Policy (LESPP) is a project created by Joe Helle, which he promised if elected as State Representative. Joe ran on a platform of creating a better informed public, leveraging their feedback to make the proper
        decisions in Columbus. Being a life long public servant, he has always placed the best interests of his community and country first, regardless of pay or position. Despite not being elected, he still believes that we are vastly
        under-served by our elected "representatives," noting that the day after an election they all but disappear.
      </p>
      <p>It's time to take back our futures. The LESPP "Legislative Feedback System" will close the gap between Columbus and our communities by providing information in an easy to find location, which allows for easy reading and a mechanism for
        sharing your thoughts. That way, when our Representative or Senator prepare to vote on an issue, they can be provided with information that they refuse to solicit from our communities. LESPP is essentially doing their jobs for them.
      </p>
      <p>We all deserve better than the broken promises that we receive from our Representative and Senator on the campaign trail. Take back your future. Create a better world for your children. It's the greatest gift we can offer them.</td>
