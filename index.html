    <p>
      Our elected officials are no longer beholden to the people, choosing instead to answer to their donors, their party, and special
      interests. An informed public is a powerful public, and it is time that our people understand what it is our "representatives"
      are doing in Columbus. Lake Erie Shores Public Policy will ensure that gap is bridged by providing you with information on
      significant legislation, as well as the opportunity to provide feedback on issues.
